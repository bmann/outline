This is the source code that runs [**Outline**](https://www.getoutline.com) and all the associated services. If you want to use Outline then you don't need to run this code, we offer a hosted version of the app at [getoutline.com](https://www.getoutline.com).

If you'd like to run your own copy of Outline or contribute to development then this is the place for you.

This is my personal fork of Outline. The original [outline repo](https://github.com/outline/outline) has Heroku support merged in, so you should go run that.
